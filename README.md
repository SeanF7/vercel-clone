<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was a practice in using Next.js and React.js to create a copy of the Vercel dashboard. It uses Next.js for routing and React.js for the components. The project is hosted on Vercel. It also uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

## What I Learned

From this project I learned a lot about Next.js and React.js. I am now more comfortable with the basics of React hooks and also more complicated forms like creating custom hooks and context providers. I also learned how to use Next.js for routing and creating API routes to use on the front end. I also am more comfortable with CSS and using it to style a project through Tailwind.
